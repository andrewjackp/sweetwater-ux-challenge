Whether I'm playing clean or with distortion, the sound is rich and full. It's a bit pricey, but the quality more than justifies the cost. I think that the grain is just gorgeous and I can spend hours just looking at it while it hangs on my wall. The pickups, offset by the black pickguard, look and sound fantastic. Each knob operates perfectly without any scratchy sounds, and the five way toggle works like a dream. I also inspected each screw on the pickguard and found that each were tightened to proper torque specs which is a real bonus. You don't want untorqued screws! Lastly, I feel like I should mention that the fret ends are rounded and smoothed to perfection.",
